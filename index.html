                <p>Hello World. My name is Ronnie Davis. I currently make a living as a loan processor. I've been in the banking and
                    finance industry for the last eight years. Outside of work I am a husband, father of one, and pet owner. In
                    my spare time, I play flag football, lift weights, and enjoy spending time with my family. I'm currently
                    enrolled in the University of Denver's Full Stack bootcamp.  At the end of bootcamp, I hope to secure a position as a Full stack Engineer or Front End Devoloper
